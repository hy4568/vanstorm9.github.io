                Created a melody generator that takes in a song from a midi, extracting musical aspects of song, recognizing patterns of the musical structure by using Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) Neural Network, and composing its own original melodies based on the patterns it had learned. Part of a long term project to create a full AI song composer, an AI that can generate entire songs with a series melodies.

              <div style="width:70%">
                Worked with a Rapiro robot by programming a computer vision program such as an emotion recognition system based on facemovements using Dense Optical Flow and trained it by using Support Vector Machines. Takes advantage of facial movements lack of vulnerability to lighting and unique facial appearance that an emotion classifier would havewith just static images, creating a more accurate and robust emotion classifier.

Calcuates both the path and information of bus route and walking route to help one determine the more efficient way of getting to a destination (takes into account the bus route, average walking and bus driving speed, and distance between each places)

                Used a motor (with rope tethered to arm) controlled by the Arduino to make a virtual reality wearable that allows the wearer to experience physical forces. Whenever the user moves / swings his arm in the VR game and a hit is detected, the Arduino recieves that information and pulls on the arm with the motor tethered to arm, creating a locking effect and imitation of a physical force.

              <div style="width:70%">
                Used the Kinect to create a workspace that is able to sense the presence of its owner. By using object detection, the
                Kinect is able to call a bash script that gives the Kinect control of the computer based on user input, creating a smart workspace. In this case the Kinect can sense when you get up from your chair and will automatically shut off the screen, this saves power and is more convenient than having to do it manually. We also included other features such as the ability to change the brightness of the screen using a hand held up to the sensor. Any other features can be added to the program and controlled with a hand held up to the Kinect.
