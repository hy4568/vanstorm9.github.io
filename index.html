              <div style="width:70%">
                Created a melody generator that takes in a song from a midi, extracting musical aspects of song, recognizing patterns of the musical structure by using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network, and composing its own original melodies based on the patterns it had learned.

              <div style="width:70%">
                Uses the A* algorithm in order to find the shortest path from point A to point B within Rutgers campus (to find buildings, bus stops, dining halls, etc) (currently Busch campus) as well as kinematics equations to find the time of the walk. Calcuates both the path and information of bus route and walking route to help one determine the more efficient way of getting to a destination (takes into account the bus route, average walking and bus driving speed, and distance between each places)

              <div style="width:70%">
                Improved face tracking sample from OpenCV documentation by combining both Harr Classifcation and Lucas Kanade optical flow algorithm. This allowed the computer to track the face/head in various different angles (front face to side face) even with limited face dataset

            <center>
              <div style="width:70%">
                Used a motor (with rope tethered to arm) controlled by the Arduino to make a virtual reality wearable that allows the wearer to experience physical forces. Whenever the user moves / swings his arm in the VR game and a hit is detected, the Arduino recieves that information and pulls on the arm with the motor tethered to arm, creating a locking effect and imitation of a physical force.

            Kinect Helper
            <br><br>
            <center>
              <div style="width:70%">
                Used the Kinect to create a workspace that is able to sense the presence of its owner. By using object detection, the
                Kinect is able to call a bash script that gives the Kinect control of the computer based on user input, creating a smart workspace. In this case the Kinect can sense when you get up from your chair and will automatically shut off the screen, this saves power and is more convenient than having to do it manually. We also included other features such as the ability to change the brightness of the screen using a hand held up to the sensor. Any other features can be added to the program and controlled with a hand held up to the Kinect.

              <div style="width:70%">
                Used the Leap Motion in order to control some computer functions using just hand gestures. This includes opening up a browser, closing a browser, putting the laptop to sleep, and locking it using hand movements. This was made in Python which was also controlling a bash script.
